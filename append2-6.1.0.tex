\section*{Appendix 4: Facilities and Other Resources}\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Appendix 4: Facilities and Other Resources}

There are two principle facilities identified for this project.
\begin{itemize}
\item Early commissioning and development experiments will be carried out in the Photon Science Laboratory Building (PSLB).
\item \textit{in situ} testing and experiments will be carried in Hutch 1.1 of the Near Experimental Hall and in the Photon Science Laboratory Building (PSLB).
\end{itemize}

Analysis resources exist from both the SLAC-unix farm and the LCLS-unix farms.  
Our long collaboration with the data analysis and controls groups at LCLS not only allows the PI particularly early insight into the computing resources, but is also motivates his active pursuit of data compression and on-board analysis algorithms.
This mutual benefit ensures the continued use and support for these computing facilities.

Office space will be available for team members with locations divided into available space in the building 901 LCLS office building with additional space for the Coffee, the RA, students and visiting scientists in the PULSE Institute of Building 40.

\subsection*{Additional Personnel}%\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Additional Personnel}

We expect yearly support at the roughly 120 hour level from AIR-TEC for electronics design and construction.

with associated laser systems: 
\begin{itemize}
\item We will continue to work in collaboration with James Cryan for intermittent testing of the spectrometer array in the EUV PULSE Lab in Building 40 at SLAC.
\item The R\&D laser lab in the PSLB will be used for detector testing and construction as the space comes available in Fall 2018.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Appendix 6: Data Management Plan}\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Appendix 6: Data Management Plan}

As stated in the Project Narrative, one of the central themes is to reduce the data load.
The data that is accumulated as part of this project will be made broadly available both internally via SLAC/LCLS unix user account access and, by inquiry to the PI and his team, via coordinated data formatting and access based on containerized analysis algorithms and raw high-fidelity sample data along with the inference input, output, and inference model weights.

Data taken with the LCLS will be stored in accordance with LCLS policy also in SLAC Central Storage (or LCLS storage if in future LCLS moves the storage service).
Access can then be granted by the PI also for any individual who obtains an LCLS user unix account. 

The simulation based data will be housed in the SLAC Central Computing.  
The PI currently maintains a 1 TB/year subscription that will be incrementally increased up to a 5 TB/year storage, expanded when needed.
Again, coordinated data formatting and access will be based on containerized (Docker or Singularity) analysis algorithms and raw high-fidelity sample data along with the inference input, output, and inference model weights.
