The advent of x-ray free electron lasers (xFELs) has brought the ability to resolve ultrafast processes in molecular and material systems on their natural time and length scales \cite{Fritz2007,Katayama2013,Mariano2013,McFarland2014}.
Given the MHz scale repetition rate of Table~\ref{lcls2specs} for the coming facility upgrade --- the Linac Coherent Light Source II (LCLS-II) --- such a measure-and-sort method would effectively require every shot be recorded, increasing the data load from the 10 TB/day of today to 100 PB/day.
Such a load would require an enormous cost for developing the ultra-high duty-cycle area detectors and the corresponding network and storage infrastructure. 

One of the biggest challenges for the attosecond science community today is the difficulty in producing significant pulse energy in the 200 eV -- 2 keV regime using high harmonic generation (HHG)\cite{Chen2014,Schmidt2016}.
These sources are encroaching on this range \cite{Biegert2014,Zenghu2017}, however the intensities and repetition rates available at FEL sources like the LCLS-II (Table \ref{lcls2specs}) are driving the community to look toward all x-ray pump-probe. 
Given the importance of understanding electron flow in photo-excited systems (Fig.~\ref{fig::cederbaum}), one can foresee the desire to optically drive electrons into concerted coherent motion \cite{Cederbaum2008,Biggs2012,Mukamel2013} and then probe the local electronic environment with time-resolved x-ray sepctroscopies.
There have been numerous schemes proposed for developing the attosecond capability of x-ray FEL facilities \cite{Ding2009,Xiang2009} with a particular push funded directly by the Office of Basic Energy Science aimed at LCLS-II implementation \cite{Marinelli2016,xLEAP}.

Achieving the full capability of attosecond x-ray laser science will require the diagnosis and control of the x-ray spectral phase.
The development of temporally shaped x-ray FEL pulses would not only facilitate attosecond pulse generation but also a number of multi-pulse non-linear techniques.
A continued progress on this front \cite{Lutman13_twocolor,Marinelli13_twocolor,Allaria2014,Marinelli2015,Prince2016,Lutman2016,Marinelli2016} will require full spectral phase, amplitude and polarization characterization. 
We therefore propose a single-shot diagnostic that reports the full temporal intensity, wavelength, and polarization distributions with $\sim$150 attoseconds resolution at the highest repetition rates, limited only by the optical laser repetition rate that is used for the streaking drive laser.


We restrict ourselves to two fundamental objectives:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \label{obj::detector} We will perform the necessary reasearch and development required to eventually deliver an optimized angular array of electron Time-of-Flight spectrometers.
\item \label{obj::analysis} We will co-develop the requisite algorithms and machine learning compliments together with the detector electronics such in odred to optimally match the real-time analysis routines with detector electronics and computing hardware that push the tenchnology envelope.
\end{enumerate}
