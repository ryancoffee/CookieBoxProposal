Multi-color, multi-polarization and multiple x-ray pulses with temporal control are all featured as LCLS-II needs for the future of our Free-Electron Laser (FEL) science. 
It is imperative to deliver a single shot diagnostic for such pulses with attosecond temporal resolution as recently demonstrated.
Attosecond resolution for photo and Auger electron time-dependent emission spectra aims to timeresolve the correlated electron motion as a core topic for LCSL-II. 
To fully capitalize on this nascent field of xFEL-based atto-science, one requires both a diagnostic of the exact temporal profile of the each Self-Amplification of Spontaneous Emission (SASE) pulse as well as its time-energy distribution.
Furthermore, there is a desperate need from the accelerator division for full spectral and polarization reconstruction of the x-ray pulses. 
We therefore must plan to recover complicated polarization and time-energy distributions for each pulse if we hope to continue our ever advancing novel modes of operation such as multi-pulse schemes taking advantage of variable gap and split undulatorsiv, Freshslice lasing, and xFEL attosecond pulse generationvi. Recent theoretical explorations into pulse reconstruction methods, point out the need to remove the current limitations of poor energy resolution and limited collection efficiency of existing electron Time-of-Flight (eToF) spectrometers.
These limitations have proven the most challenging impediments to x-ray pulse reconstruction.

The scope of this proposed project is the Research and Development needed to produce an angular array of 16 novel electron Time-of-Flight spectrometers. 
The specifications for this angular array are set by the needs for the reliable reconstruction of SASE x-ray pulses of complicated spectrum, polarization, and temporal structureâ€”the polarization sensitive Time-Energy distribution.
