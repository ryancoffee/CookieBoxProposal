\paragraph*{Ultrafast electron diffraction (UED)}
%\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Ultrafast electron diffraction (UED)}
The PI has recently become intimately involved with the use of ultrafast electron diffraction (UED) in order to merge spectroscopic studies at the LCLS with the structural sensitivity of electron diffraction \cite{ued_rsi2015,Jie2016}.
The merger of the two experimental paradigms is enabled by induced time-domain coherent molecular motions that in-turn produce concerted fluctuations in both x-ray spectra and in electron diffraction features.
By pattern recognizing these common-mode fluctuations, one can merge experimental results as if the two experiments were performed simultaneously.
The PI is therefore keenly attuned to need for exquisite synchronization at high energy ultrafast electron diffraction sources.
The successful outcome of Objective~\ref{obj::controlling} would be immediately applicable to high energy electron diffraction facilities.% such as SLAC's UED facility, LBNL's facility, and others.


\paragraph*{Deep ultra-violet}
During period two, the LCLS facility will be down.
Here we will draw on our existing research program investigating routes to broad-band tunable deep uv.
This collaborative work together with the Keinberger group of TU Munich produced a Marie-Curie Fellowship project of Wolfram Helml to develop ultra-broadband, sub-10 fs duration deep ultraviolet pulses.
This project later led to a Masters student research project of Patrick Rupprecht to develop the required pulse characterization in the deep uv regime.
This deep ultraviolet will be used as a surrogate for the x-ray pulse during the LCLS down time from August 2018 -- August 2019.
This existing setup will continue to serve as a surrogate source for testing and debugging new concepts and materials. 

\paragraph*{Stanford Medical}
%\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Stanford Medical}
The PI has recently opened a new collaboration with the group of Dr.~Craig Levin in the Division of Nuclear Medicine at Stanford.
Through this collaboration we expect a mutually beneficial investigation into novel scintillation materials for improving the cascade time and the signal per dose ratio.
Such a time resolution would greatly improve the spatial resolution of the PET scan per unit time spent undergoing the scan. 
Ideally one could imagine then making such scans in short time-series if each scan only takes a few seconds.
Then one can observe the dynamic processes in e.g.~brain activity.

\paragraph*{X-ray pulse shaping}
%\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{X-ray pulse shaping}
The PI has played a central role in motivating and helping the development of the many electron bunch based methods for x-ray pulse shaping \cite{Lutman13_twocolor,Marinelli13_twocolor,Helml2014,Marinelli2015,Lutman2016,Marinelli2016}.
From performing the first double-slotted foil experiment for two x-ray pulses \cite{CoffeeDAMOP11} to demonstrating optical carving of the electron bunch \cite{Marinelli2016} and helping demonstrate multi-polarization multi-color operation \cite{Lutman2016}, our group has helped to pioneer many of the pulse shaping schemes that have been developed thus far at the LCLS.
On the active forefront of pulse shaping, he is uniquely positioned to develop the pulse shape diagnostics hand-in-hand with the accelerator R\&D for which he is already an active contributor.
This close overlap with the LCLS Accelerator R\&D group is in fact what allows for the shared resources such as the two Project Scientist/RA positions to be shared so intimately.
These positions will be fundamentally interwoven between the development of novel FEL methods and the attosecond diagnostics required to interrogate those methods.


\paragraph*{Machine learning}
%\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Machine learning}

Such so-called ``deep learning'' is used to interrogate the output of the artificial neural networks to check the physical interpretation of how the output is determined \cite{Mihir}.
Our preliminary test, shown in Fig.~\ref{mlsorted}, uses the neural network classifier to sort LCLS shots based on a CNN predicted two-color spectral distribution.
The sorted shots are shown at right and an example of an XTCAV image is shown in the top left of Fig.~\ref{mlsorted}.
Guided back propagation is then used to interrogate the neural network about which regions of that image influenced the sorting most strongly, and this is shown in the lower left.
These two regions indeed indicate the loss of electron energy due to the lasing process, thus boosting our confidence that the CNN is sorting based on valid physical properties of the x-ray pulse, photon energy separation in this case.
