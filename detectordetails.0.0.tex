With attosecond streaking, the angular acceptance of the electron spectrometers are a principle concern \cite{Worner2018}.
The angular acceptance of the eTOFs will be adjusted such that we relax slightly the collection for the sake of preserving the resolution.

Given the recently demonstrated VMI version of angular streaking \cite{attoclockVMI2013}, we have explored VMI \cite{James2018} but predict that we can cover the multi-color resoltuion windos more effectively with an array of eTOFs.
Although we will continue our parallel research with the VIM, we expect the single resolution window of the VMI will preclude its use for the kinds of novel pulses we have come to expect from LCLS.
