\imput{active.realtimeanalysis.tex}





%This measurement will require a near \textit{in situ} implementation. %though it is fully compatible with feeding back into the synchronization system.
We propose to investigate a near \textit{in situ} interferometric version of spectrogram encoding, a hybrid of spectral and spatial encoding \cite{Nick2014}, to achieve 100 attosecond level delay resolution.
%A hybrid of spectral and spatial encoding, a two-dimensional spectrogram encoding method can provide even further time sorting resolution \cite{Nick2014}.
By crossing the chirped continuum beam relative to the x-ray beam in the material, we obtain a spatially-encoded arrival time in addition to the spectrally-encoded arrival time (Fig.~\ref{2dinterferesim}, spatial=vertical and spectral=horizontal). 
Multiple one-dimensional lineouts provide redundant measurements of the arrival time, e.g.~spectrally multiplexing the spatially encoded timing signal or vice versa.
Related to techniques used in de-noising images \cite{Candes2004a,Candes2004b,Candes2005,Elad2006}, the multiplexing provides an effective $\sqrt{N}$ improvement in the signal fidelity and thus a more accurately located edge.
This multiplexing makes for a more demanding sensitivity requirement than for the one dimensional system.
%The sensitivity requirement for the two-dimensional system is much more demanding than the one dimensional version.
%This makes the materials properties and thermal load particularly challenging for two-dimensional spectrogram encoding.
We will need to spread that original few pixel wide signal across the spatial dimension of the spectrograph to cover a few hundred pixel wide region.
In order to gain a factor of 10 in temporal resolution, one must multiplex in one of the two dimensions by a factor of 100.
This requires a 100 fold increase in signal compared to normal spectral encoding.
Here again interferometric sensitivity will help.

We plan to have the base system ready for diagnosing the residual temporal jitter of LCLS-II in advance of the first light in mid-2019.

We will benchmark the resolution of the angular streaking method by measuring attosecond and multi-pulse, multi-color, multi-polarization mode of Ref.~\cite{Lutman2016} to benchmark our ability to directly measure the full time-dependent spectrum and polarization of novel shaped x-ray FEL pulses.

\subsection*{Responsibilities of key project personnel\label{personnell}}
%\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Responsibilities of key project personnel}

The PI will be responsible for organizing the major efforts including algorithm development, optical design, and coordination of engineering design and hardware construction.
He is expected to contribute 65\% of his effort to this project.

The first RA/Project Scientist will be hired at the 75\% level with 25\% of his or her effort will be shared with closely related Accelerator R\&D projects.
He or she will work primarily on the optical construction and execution of the experiments in the first two years for the interferometric timing effort.
In addition, he or she will organize an initial preliminary benchmark test of attosecond angular streaking based on the Viefhaus CookieBox that will be borrowed from DESY.
He or she will begin the effort of designing the CookieBox detector that will be used in the attosecond angular streaking effort.
A second RA/Project Scientist will take over the CookieBox detector construction and will lead the attosecond streaking beamtime preparations in years 3-5.
He or she will focus also on the optical design and fabrication responsibilities for the final dedicated CookieBox detector and required laser implementation.

We intend to recruit two graduate students from Stanford University to participate in the project.
We will seek funding through student research fellowships and LCLS-sponsored student outreach programs.
Related research by the PI has attracted numerous externally funded post-doctoral fellows and visiting scientists, most notably Wofram Helml (Marie Curie Foundation), Anton Lidahl (Wallenberg Foundation), and Markus Ilchen (Volkswagen Foundation).
We expect these collaborative relasionships to continue.
In particular, the close collaboration with the Kienberger Group of TU Munich/MPQ Garching Germany is often financially supported through the Bavaria California Technology Center (BaCaTeC) program \cite{BaCaTeC}.

\subsection*{Synergistic Activities}
%\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Synergistic Activities}

\paragraph*{Ultrafast electron diffraction (UED)}
%\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Ultrafast electron diffraction (UED)}
The PI has recently become intimately involved with the use of ultrafast electron diffraction (UED) in order to merge spectroscopic studies at the LCLS with the structural sensitivity of electron diffraction \cite{ued_rsi2015,Jie2016}.
The merger of the two experimental paradigms is enabled by induced time-domain coherent molecular motions that in-turn produce concerted fluctuations in both x-ray spectra and in electron diffraction features.
By pattern recognizing these common-mode fluctuations, one can merge experimental results as if the two experiments were performed simultaneously.
The PI is therefore keenly attuned to need for exquisite synchronization at high energy ultrafast electron diffraction sources.
The successful outcome of Objective~\ref{obj::controlling} would be immediately applicable to high energy electron diffraction facilities.% such as SLAC's UED facility, LBNL's facility, and others.


\paragraph*{Deep ultra-violet}
During period two, the LCLS facility will be down.
Here we will draw on our existing research program investigating routes to broad-band tunable deep uv.
This collaborative work together with the Keinberger group of TU Munich produced a Marie-Curie Fellowship project of Wolfram Helml to develop ultra-broadband, sub-10 fs duration deep ultraviolet pulses.
This project later led to a Masters student research project of Patrick Rupprecht to develop the required pulse characterization in the deep uv regime.
This deep ultraviolet will be used as a surrogate for the x-ray pulse during the LCLS down time from August 2018 -- August 2019.
This existing setup will continue to serve as a surrogate source for testing and debugging new concepts and materials. 

%\paragraph*{Stanford Medical}
%\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Stanford Medical}
%The PI has recently opened a new collaboration with the group of Dr.~Craig Levin in the Division of Nuclear Medicine at Stanford.
%Through this collaboration we expect a mutually beneficial investigation into novel scintillation materials for improving the cascade time and the signal per dose ratio.
%Such a time resolution would greatly improve the spatial resolution of the PET scan per unit time spent undergoing the scan. 
%Ideally one could imagine then making such scans in short time-series if each scan only takes a few seconds.
%Then one can observe the dynamic processes in e.g.~brain activity.


\paragraph*{X-ray pulse shaping}
%\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{X-ray pulse shaping}
The PI has played a central role in motivating and helping the development of the many electron bunch based methods for x-ray pulse shaping \cite{Lutman13_twocolor,Marinelli13_twocolor,Helml2014,Marinelli2015,Lutman2016,Marinelli2016}.
From performing the first double-slotted foil experiment for two x-ray pulses \cite{CoffeeDAMOP11} to demonstrating optical carving of the electron bunch \cite{Marinelli2016} and helping demonstrate multi-polarization multi-color operation \cite{Lutman2016}, our group has helped to pioneer many of the pulse shaping schemes that have been developed thus far at the LCLS.
On the active forefront of pulse shaping, he is uniquely positioned to develop the pulse shape diagnostics hand-in-hand with the accelerator R\&D for which he is already an active contributor.
This close overlap with the LCLS Accelerator R\&D group is in fact what allows for the shared resources such as the two Project Scientist/RA positions to be shared so intimately.
These positions will be fundamentally interwoven between the development of novel FEL methods and the attosecond diagnostics required to interrogate those methods.


\paragraph*{Machine learning}
%\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Machine learning}

Such so-called ``deep learning'' is used to interrogate the output of the artificial neural networks to check the physical interpretation of how the output is determined \cite{Mihir}.
Our preliminary test, shown in Fig.~\ref{mlsorted}, uses the neural network classifier to sort LCLS shots based on a CNN predicted two-color spectral distribution.
The sorted shots are shown at right and an example of an XTCAV image is shown in the top left of Fig.~\ref{mlsorted}.
Guided back propagation is then used to interrogate the neural network about which regions of that image influenced the sorting most strongly, and this is shown in the lower left.
These two regions indeed indicate the loss of electron energy due to the lasing process, thus boosting our confidence that the CNN is sorting based on valid physical properties of the x-ray pulse, photon energy separation in this case.

There are two principle lab spaces identified for this project.
\begin{itemize}
\item LCLS-AMO laser system when not in use by user experiments, this is the primary laser for the x-ray spectroscopy arm of this program.
\item Laser only based commissioning and development experiments will be carried out in one of the new laser labs in the Photon Science Laboratory Building (PSLB).

Analysis resources exist from both the SLAC-unix farm and the LCLS-unix farms.  
Our long collaboration with the data analysis and controls groups at LCLS not only allows the PI particularly early insight into the computing resources, but is also motivates his active pursuit of data compression and on-board analysis algorithms.
This mutual benefit ensures the continued use and support for these computing facilities.

The data that is accumulated as part of this project will be made broadly available both internally via SLAC/LCLS unix user account access and, by inquiry to the PI, externally via coordinated data formatting and access FTP.

Data taken with the LCLS will be stored in accordance with LCLS policy also in SLAC Central Storage (or LCLS storage if in future LCLS moves the storage service).
Access can then be granted by the PI also for any individual who obtains an LCLS user unix account. 

The laser lab based data will be housed in the SLAC Central Computing.  
The PI currently maintains a 1 TB/year subscription and that will be incrementally increased up to a 5 TB/year storage, expanded when needed.
%The subscription cost is included in the budget.
The data will be made broadly available by SLAC unix account access and externally by contacting the PI and coordinating an FTP service of the data.
