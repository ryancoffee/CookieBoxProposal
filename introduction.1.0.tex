The advent of x-ray free electron lasers (xFELs) brought the ability to resolve ultrafast processes in molecular and material systems on their natural vibrational time and length scales \cite{Fritz2007,Katayama2013,Mariano2013,McFarland2014}.
With the coming of the next genreation xFEL, the Linac Coherent Light Source II (LCLS-II) the electronic horizon is upon us: we will use attosecond x-ray pulses to control and interrogate the correlated electronic motion as we delve into the age of molecular electronic movies.
Given the importance of understanding electronic flow in photo-excited systems (Fig.~\ref{fig::cederbaum}), there is a strong desire to drive electrons into concerted coherent motion \cite{Cederbaum2008,Biggs2012,Mukamel2013} and then probe the molecular environment with time-resolved atomic site-specific x-ray sepctroscopies.
Opening the field of attoscience to the xFEL machine, inspires one to imagine attosecond resolved extension to two-dimensional resonant Auger electron spectrosopies of Ref.~\cite{Piancastelli2013}.
This inspiration has led to direct funding of a major research effort focused specifically on attacking this regime with FEL sources \cite{ArtemFOA}.

One of the biggest challenges for the traditionally laser-based attosecond science community is the difficulty in producing significant pulse energy in the 200 eV -- 2 keV regime using high harmonic generation (HHG)\cite{Chen2014,Schmidt2016}.
These sources may be encroaching on this x-ray photon energy range \cite{Biegert2014,Zenghu2017} but the intensities and repetition rates available at FEL sources like the LCLS-II (Table \ref{lcls2specs}) are driving the community to look toward all x-ray pump-probe. 
There have been numerous schemes proposed for developing the attosecond capability of x-ray FEL facilities \cite{Ding2009,Xiang2009} with a particular push funded by the Office of Basic Energy Science aimed at LCLS-II implementation \cite{Marinelli2016,xLEAP}.

The development of temporally shaped x-ray FEL pulses would not only facilitate attosecond pulse generation but also a number of multi-pulse non-linear techniques\cite{Review2017}.
A continued progress on this front \cite{Lutman13_twocolor,Marinelli13_twocolor,Allaria2014,Marinelli2015,Prince2016,Lutman2016,Marinelli2016} will require full spectral phase, amplitude and polarization characterization as recently demonstrated in Ref.~\cite{Nick2018}.
We therefore propose a single-shot diagnostic that reports the full temporal intensity, wavelength, and polarization distributions with $\sim$150 attoseconds resolution at the highest repetition rates, limited only by the optical laser repetition rate that is used for the streaking drive laser.

We identify two fundamental but parallel objectives:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \emph{Detector:} We will perform the necessary reasearch and development required to design an optimized angular array of electron Time-of-Flight spectrometers.
\item \emph{Analysis:} We will integratively develop the requisite algorithms and machine learning compliments together to optimally match the real-time analysis routines with detector electronics and computing hardware that pushes the tenchnology envelope.
\end{enumerate}
